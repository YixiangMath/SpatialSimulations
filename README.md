Code for the paper "A Diffusion Model for Community Transmission of Covid-19 Epidemics: Application to Brazil"

(1) I am using Matlab R2020a, and the code does not run in earlier versions of Matlab. 

(2) Before running any Matlab file, we need to download the population data from 

https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11

I am using the year 2015 population density data. 

(3) Run the following files:
Brazil_Solve8.m;
Brazil_Plot.m;
Brazil_District.m;
Brazil_DistrictDensity4.m
